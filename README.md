# IoT-Segmentation

Separating the 17 smart devices onto a separate network for enhanced security

As the caption states, I will be attempting to create a dedicated network at my parent's house for their numerous IoT devices. 
Their current setup is typical the non-technical: Smart devices connected to the same home internet network. 
We are familiar with the security implications of this, so I decided to take matters into my own hands and air gap these devices. 

I initially wanted to experiment in depth such as implementing these changes on a VLAN rather than a separate LAN. In addition, I want to deploy a honeypot for threat analysis. However, for the time being, I will start with a basic segmentatio.
